### My Experiences 🙌

<details>
<summary>Major League Hacking Spring Fellow 2022 at Solana Labs 🦀</summary>
<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Was mentored under [Jon Cinque](https://github.com/joncinque), [Wei He](https://github.com/wei) and [Gage Bachik](https://github.com/GageBachik). Worked on the project [Solana Program Library](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library), fixed issues on the repository. Worked on porting SPL programs to Anchor framework. 
	<details>
	<summary>Issue: Added a checker to check if the recipient address of a token transfer is owned by System Program</summary>
	<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;[Pull Request](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/pull/3085)
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Spl-token transfer didn't check if the recipient address was actually owned by System Program or not. This lead to a lot of loss when 			people sent a lot of funds to a wallet owned by a token. Added a check along with a flag to go past the check. 
	</details>
	<details>
	<summary>Issue: Porting the existing Memo program to Anchor Framework</summary>
	<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;[Pull Request](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/pull/3024)
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;The Memo program in SPL is working and written in Vanilla Rust as of now. I got it recreated in Anchor which is a Rust framework. Added 		the same tests which were there for a previous program and made the PR.
	</details>
	<details>
	<summary>Issue: Categorized the dependancies of token/js</summary>
	<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;[Pull Request](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/pull/2881)
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;The dependancies in the package.json file need to be corrected as per the requirement on the dev side.  
	</details>
	<details>
	<summary>Issue: Documentation error in token/js</summary>
	<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;[Pull Request](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/pull/2879)
		<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;There was an error in the documentation of the Readme of token/js regarding a subdirectory.
